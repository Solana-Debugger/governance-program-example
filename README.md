# Solana Debugger: Governance program example

This repository stores an example program meant to be used with the Solana Debugger.

It already contains the `save_input` module, which means you can use tests to generate debug inputs, which can then be used for the debugger.

This is a snapshot of the governance program and will not be updated.
